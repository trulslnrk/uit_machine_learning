The Machine Learning group have an internal debate about music and need some
help from. For a few of their favorite songs, they disagree on the genre it should be classified in. Some
of them think they are inspired by Pop and should be tagged "Pop", but a minority think that the influence
comes from Classical music and should be classified in this category instead. In order to end this dispute,
i am asked to design a machine that classify automatically a song, given its features

The model that is for classifying is trained on the `SpotifyFeatures.csv` file. The code and also plots for the showing error rates,
 showing the split of the datasets, confusion matrix is in the `assignment_1.ipynb` file
